<h2>The signifigance of Blaise Pascals's contribution to compter science<h2>

  <p>Pascal's work in probability and combinatorics contributed to the mathematical theories that underpin algorithms and computational methods used in computer science today.<p>
    <h2>Influence on The programming language<h2>
    <p>Influence on Programming Languages: The programming language Pascal, developed in the 1970s, was named in his honor. It emphasized structured programming and data structuring, influencing the development of many modern programming languages.<p>
        <h2>Contribution to algortihms<h2>
        <p>Blaise Pascal's invention of the Pascaline, one of the first mechanical calculators, was pivotal in automating arithmetic calculations, laying the groundwork for future computing devices using his theories that were the model for early algorithms<p>
