<h2>The signifigance of Blaise Pascals's contribution to compter science<h2>

  <p>Pascal's work in probability and combinatorics contributed to the mathematical theories that underpin algorithms and computational methods used in computer science today.<p>
    <h2>Influence on The programming language<h2>
    <p>Influence on Programming Languages: The programming language Pascal, developed in the 1970s, was named in his honor. It emphasized structured programming and data structuring, influencing the development of many modern programming languages.<p>
        <h2>Contribution to algortihms<h2>
        <p>In the early 1640s, Blaise Pascal, still a teenager, invented the first mechanical calculator. Popularly known as the Pascaline, this artifact kicked off a technological revolution of machines as helpers in solving math<p>
