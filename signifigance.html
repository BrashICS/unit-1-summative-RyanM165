 <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Signifigance of Blaise Pascals's Contribution To Computer Science</h2>
<div>
  <p>Pascal's work in probability and combinatorics contributed to the mathematical theories that underpin algorithms and computational methods used in computer science today.Contribution to computer science 
    His work in probability theory helped lay the foundation for decision making processes in computing and the development of algorithms that handle uncertainty. 
    
    In summary Blaise pascalâ€™s inventions and ideas contributed to the early development of mechanical computing, influenced logical and mathematical foundations of computer science, and inspired the creation of a key programming language without the first calculator we could not have made advanced computers

    <h3>Influence on The programming language<h3>
    <p>Influence on Programming Languages: The programming language Pascal, developed in the 1970s, was named in his honor. It emphasized structured programming and data structuring, influencing the development of many modern programming languages.<p>
        <h2>Contribution to algortihms<h2>
        <p>In the early 1640s, Blaise Pascal, still a teenager, invented the first mechanical calculator. Popularly known as the Pascaline, this artifact kicked off a technological revolution of machines as helpers in solving math<p>
