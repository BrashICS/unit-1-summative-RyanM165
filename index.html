    <p style="text-align:center;">Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. He made significant contributions to various fields, including geometry, probability theory, and fluid mechanics. Pascal is also known for his work on the invention of the mechanical calculator, called the Pascaline, which was one of the first devices capable of performing arithmetic operations.</p>


<div>Pascal’s Wager and Probability theory had significant applications in computer science especially in algorithms, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
  His work in probability theory helped lay the foundation for decision making processes in computing Pascal's Triangle: He is famous for developing Pascal’s Triangle, a triangular array that reveals binomial coefficients and is fundamental to combinatorics.
  
  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Contribution to computer science</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;">His work in probability theory helped lay the foundation for decision making processes in computing and the development of algorithms that handle uncertainty. 
  </p> 
    In summary Blaise pascal’s inventions and ideas contributed to the early development of mechanical computing, influenced logical and mathematical foundations of computer science, and inspired the creation of a key programming language without the first calculator we could not have made advanced computers
