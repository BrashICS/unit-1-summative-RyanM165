    <div>Blaise Pascal helped his father, Étienne Pascal, primarily due to family circumstances and his father's health. Étienne was a tax collector in Rouen, and as he faced difficulties with his work and health issues, Blaise took on responsibilities to assist him. This included engaging in mathematical work and developing inventions, which not only supported his father's career but also allowed Blaise to pursue his own intellectual interests. Their close relationship and collaboration fostered an environment that encouraged Blaise's later groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and science.<div>
